<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    "Aburi," the technique applied to this aburi steak, 
    means flame-seared in Japanese. The technique is often
    applied to raw fish, but it works well for tender, marbled
    beef cuts, too. A butane torch lets you customize the 
    doneness. Torch less or more depending on how charred you 
    like it.
