<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This one pan chicken breast and asparagus in lemon cream sauce
    is a tempting one-skillet main dish, and delicious with mashed
    potatoes or mashed cauliflower. Red pepper flakes bring a tiny
    bit of heat to the sauce, so use as much or as little as you 
    wish.
